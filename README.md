# Creating an AWS VPC with 2 Public Subnets

This Terraform code creates an AWS VPC with 2 public subnets, an internet gateway, and a route table. The subnets are configured to automatically assign public IP addresses to instances launched within them.

The VPC CIDR block, subnet CIDR blocks, and availability zones are defined in `variables.tf`.

To create the VPC and subnets, run the following commands:

```
terraform init
terraform apply
```

After the VPC and subnets are created, you can launch instances within the public subnets and they will automatically be assigned public IP addresses.

Example output:

```
Outputs:

public_subnet_ids = [
  "subnet-0123456789abcdef",
  "subnet-abcdef0123456789",
]
